# EDUStavebnice
We are a project built by high school students who aim to receive so-called teaching practice among people. We believe that teaching must move over time and that anyone can help. We are a team of people made up of different interests, experiences and missions.

Project dealing with kits and its educational materials. We support teaching through practice and we try to supply our kits to everyone who is interested, ie schools, interest groups or non-profit organizations. We keep up with the times and our kits are no longer just material. You can also download unique applications for our kits.

Here on GitHub you can find our work, back of work, work of our project. If you interest, you could build or make something, that you find here.
